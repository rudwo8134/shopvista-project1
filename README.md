## SHIPVISTA Project

##### requirement
  1. As a user, I want to see a list of plants on a web page, as well as their watering status
  2. As a user, I want to start and stop watering of a plant. A plant takes 10 seconds to
water.
  3. The system should support watering multiple plants at the same time. 
  4. Plants need to rest from watering, so as a User, I should not be able to water the plant
again within 30 seconds of the last watering session.
  5. As a user, I should be visually alerted if a plant hasnâ€™t been watered for more than 6
hours.
